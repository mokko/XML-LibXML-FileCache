NAME
    XML::LibXML::FileCache - A simple file cache for LibXML (CHI-based)

VERSION
    version 0.001

DESCRIPTION
    A simple file cache for LibXML documents based on CHI for small web
    documents. Cache is populated when document is first accessed (get) or
    everytime when document is accessed (getFallback).

FUNCTIONS
  my $cache=new My::FileCache(cacheDir=>'path/to/dir');
    Options cacheDir (required): directory in which cached files are stored
    cacheDir is not created automatically. Make sure that dir exists!

    expire (optional): TODO not yet implemented expire can be empty, integer
    (seconds) and 'never'.

  my $dom=get ('http://URL.com');
    Try cache first. If it fails, try live (web). If all fails, return
    undef.

  my $file=getFromCache ($url);
    Get a file from the cache or return nothing.

  $cache->remove ([$url]);
            TODO: should remove complete cache if no argument given.
            Return value 1 for successful removal 0 for no removal.

  my $dom=$cache->getFallback ('http://URL.com');
    Check live for url first on the web. If document not live, take it from
    cache. Return undef if all fails.

    UNTESTED.

DEVELOPMENT
<https://github.com/mokko/XML-LibXML-FileCache>
BACKGROUND
    Sometimes on my development system, I don't have access to the internet,
    so I can't validate against xsd files on the web. Annoying! So I
    invented this little cache.

SEE ALSO

TODO
    *   write more tests

    *   check if $url is in fact a valid URI
